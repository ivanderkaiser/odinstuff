        <h2><p>Steps</p></h2>
        <h3>
            <ol>
                <li>For the dough, tip the flour into a large bowl. Add the salt and sugar on one side, the yeast on the other. Heat the milk in a small pan until warm but not hot. Add the butter and ¾ of the milk to the flour, then turn the mixture round with the fingers of one hand.</li>
                <li>Add the remaining milk a little at a time, mixing until you have taken in all the flour and the dough is soft and slightly sticky.</li>
                <li>Oil the worktop to prevent sticking. Knead the dough on it for at least five minutes until smooth and no longer sticky. Lightly oil the bowl, return the dough to it and cover. Leave to rise until doubled in size.</li>
                <li>For the jam, place the strawberries in a small deep-sided saucepan and crush them with a masher. Add the sugar and bring to the boil over a low heat until the sugar has melted. Increase the heat and boil for 4 minutes. Remove from the heat and carefully pour into a heat-proof bowl. Leave to cool and chill to set.</li>
                <li>Line two baking trays with baking parchment. Scrape the dough out of the bowl onto a lightly floured surface and fold inwards repeatedly until all the air has been knocked out and the dough is smooth. Divide into 8 pieces.</li>
                <li>Roll each piece into a ball by placing it into a cage formed by your hand on the work surface and moving your hand in a circular motion, rotating the ball rapidly.</li>
                <li>Put the balls of dough on the prepared baking trays, placing them slightly apart. Place each tray in a clean plastic bag or loosely cover with clingfilm and leave to prove for about 40 minutes until the rolls have doubled in size.</li>
                <li>Heat the oven to 200°C / Fan 180°C / 400°F / Gas 6 and bake for 12-15 minutes until the rolls are golden and sound hollow when tapped underneath. Place on a wire rack to cool.</li>
                <li>For the chantilly, whip the cream, vanilla, and icing sugar until it holds a medium firm peak and chill until ready to fill the buns. Using a serrated knife, cut a deep slit into the top of each bun. Spread the jam on both sides of the split, then generously fill each bun with whipped cream. Using a palette knife, smooth the cream flush with the top of the bun.</li>
                <li>To decorate, lay the strawberry slices in a line along the length of the cream filling, gently pressing them into the cream until flush. Dust with icing sugar to serve.</li>
